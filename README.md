# A News Aggregation App made with Next.js + Tailwind CSS 

a news aggregation platform that provides users with a wealth of information from multiple sources. This platform is designed with the user in mind, offering a clean, modern, and user-friendly interface that allows users to quickly find the articles they are interested in. The platform was built using a range of cutting-edge technologies and tools, including StepZen, MediaStack-API, TailwindCSS, Next.js, Hero-Icons, Dark/Light Mode, Graphql, and TypeScript. These technologies allowed me to create a highly efficient and effective platform that provides users with a seamless browsing experience.

One of the key features of this platform is its integration with MediaStack and Graphql, which provides a rich and diverse collection of news and information from various sources. The use of Graphql also allows for a robust and efficient REST API, ensuring that users have access to the latest news and information in real-time. The system synced light and dark modes provide users with an optimal viewing experience, no matter their preference for a lighter or darker theme.

Overall, this project represents my commitment to creating innovative and user-friendly web applications that deliver exceptional results. I am confident that this news aggregation platform will provide users with an enjoyable and informative experience, and I look forward to continuing to develop and improve it in the future.
